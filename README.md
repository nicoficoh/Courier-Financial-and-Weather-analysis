# Financial and weather analysis of a courier activity

Jupyter notebook with the data I collected while I was working as a courier connected with weather data analysis.

On meteo_csv there's a list of the .csv files of the weather condition in Berlin from December to April 2021.

On imput data we found:

    1) Work - Foglio1.csv --> Spreadsheet with stats related to my courier activity,these data I collected manually at the end of every shift.
    2) Work_analysis.csv --> Same spreedsheet but reworked but modify reworked, merged with meteorological data
    
    
I've divided my work into a 'financial' analysis jupyter notebook:

      Work-Analysis-Courier.ipynb --> Jupyter Notebook of statistical exploration of different variables such as Earnings and Tips .
 
And a further jupyter notebook with weather analysis:

      Weather-Analysis-Courier.ipynb --> Jupyter Notebook EDA of different parameters taking into account also daily weather.


Those notebook are also in .html format for better visualization into HTLM folder.
